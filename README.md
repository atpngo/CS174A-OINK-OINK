This is a endless runner game inspired by Subway Surfers and was created using tiny-graphics.
The player operates a pig, and has to duck, jump, and dodge a variety of obstacles, and the 
longer the player survives, the higher the score will be. Furthermore, the player is able to collect
coins to further increase the score. As time progresses, the obstacles move faster and faster.
